Okay Sabiha, I see what‚Äôs happening ‚Äî when you run git branch without any flags, Git only shows local branches.

Since your collaborator created a branch called minhaz and pushed it to GitHub, it‚Äôs currently a remote branch for you. You need to fetch it first, then check it out.

Steps to get your collaborator‚Äôs branch
1Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch all remote branches from GitHub
bash
Copy
Edit
git fetch origin
2Ô∏è‚É£ See all branches (local + remote)
bash
Copy
Edit
git branch -a
You should now see something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
* main
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/minhaz
3Ô∏è‚É£ Switch to the minhaz branch
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout minhaz
If this says branch doesn‚Äôt exist locally, create it tracking the remote branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b minhaz origin/minhaz
4Ô∏è‚É£ Merge minhaz branch into main (optional)
If you just want the changes from minhaz into main:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
git merge origin/minhaz
üí° Tip: If you just pulled (git pull) while on main, you won‚Äôt get the minhaz branch‚Äôs code unless you merge it or switch to it.

If you want, I can give you a one-line command that fetches and checks out the minhaz branch in one go. Would you like that?
