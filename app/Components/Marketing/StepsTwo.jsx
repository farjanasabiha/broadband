            if you’re not engaged in social media listening, you’re creating
            your business strategy with blinders on—and you’re missing out on
            mountains of actionable insights from real people who are actively
            talking about you or your industry online.

          <p className="text-[18px] mt-5">
            Here’s how to start listening and building your understanding of
            your audience and their needs.

          <p className="text-[18px] mt-5">
            Knowing who your audience is and what they want to see on social is
            key to creating content that they will like, comment on, and share.
            This knowledge also critical for planning how to develop your social
            media fans into customers for your business.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[18px] mt-5">
            Try creating audience personas. For example, a retail brand might
            create different personas based on demographics, buying motivations,
            common buying objections, and the emotional needs of each type of
            customer.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[18px] mt-5">
            Personas sharpen your marketing tactics. Luxury buyers, for example,
            might not respond to Facebook ads with sales. But they might respond
            to Facebook ads with exclusive in-store events to be the first to
            see a new line of clothing. With personas, you’ll have the customer
            insights you need to create campaigns that speak to the real desires
            and motivations of your buyers.

            Don’t make assumptions. Social media analytics can also provide a
            ton of valuable information about who your followers are, where they
            live, which languages they speak, and how they interact with your
            brand on social. These insights allow you to refine your strategy
            and better target your social ads.

            Jugnoo, an Uber-like service for auto-rickshaws in India, used
            Facebook Analytics to learn that 90 percent of their users who
            referred other customers were between 18 and 34 years old, and that
            65 percent of that group was using Android. They used this
            information to target their ads, resulting in a 40 percent lower
            cost per referral.
